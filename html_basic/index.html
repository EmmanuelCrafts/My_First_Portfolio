  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

  <p>This is my very first webpage created using HTML. I'm learning the basics of web development through ALX, and it's exciting to see how everything comes together!</p>

  <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>

  <p>So far, I’ve learned how to structure a basic HTML document, add paragraphs, and use different heading levels. It’s amazing how simple tags can create an organized webpage.</p>

  <h3>What’s Next?</h3>

  <p>Next, I plan to learn how to style my page using CSS and later add interactivity with JavaScript. This is just the beginning!</p>

  <p>I’m also looking forward to building a personal portfolio that showcases my skills and projects. Stay tuned!</p>
