## Project Structure

- **Directory:** `html_basic`
  - Contains basic HTML files such as `base_index.html`, `index.html`, and `tweets.html`.
  - Focuses on creating simple, valid HTML pages, embedding tweets, adding navigation, and structuring content with semantic tags.

- **Directory:** `portfolio`
  - Contains the personal portfolio webpage `index.html`.
  - Demonstrates a professional portfolio structure with multiple sections: Introduction, Projects, About Me, and Contact.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Basic Structure
- Created a valid basic HTML file `base_index.html` with:
  - Proper DOCTYPE declaration
  - `<head>` with `<title>`
  - `<body>` tag
- Validated the HTML using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org).

### 1. Make a cool first webpage
- Copied `base_index.html` to `index.html`.
- Added content including:
  - At least 4 paragraphs
  - Headings with `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>`
  - A clickable image linking to an external URL

### 2. Make a cool other webpage
- Created `tweets.html` by copying `base_index.html`.
- Embedded at least one tweet using Twitter's official embed code.
- Added navigation links between `index.html` and `tweets.html`.

### 3. Make a cool website with consistent structure
- Ensured both `index.html` and `tweets.html` share the same structure:
  - `<body>` contains `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` tags in order.
  - `<header>` has navigation links (`<ul>` and `<li>`) to both pages.
  - `<footer>` includes a credit paragraph with author and a link.
  - `<main>` includes `<article>` for main content and `<aside>` with placeholder text.

### 4. Add some level of creativity
- Updated `index.html` with a table listing learner information using `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>`.

### 5. Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
- Created a professional portfolio page in `portfolio/index.html` with:
  - Semantic HTML5 elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`
  - Navigation links to Introduction, Projects, About Me, and Contact sections
  - Multiple content sections describing skills, projects, and contact info
  - Contact section with email and external links opening in new tabs
